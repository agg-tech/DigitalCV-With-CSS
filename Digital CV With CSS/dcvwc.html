        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>State the position you seek, the organization you want to work for (if applicable), and a few job-related skills you are bringing to the table (a.k.a. your “pitch”). In the second sentence, offer a little more about your character (soft skills) and tie in your personal mission; this is a good place to add some keyword filler for ATS if you cannot find a place to do so elsewhere in the resume. Stick to 1-2 sentences.</p>
